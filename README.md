# Breathe
A counted breath visualizer

## About
Based on the TimeCircles plugin, this uses the time circle to create a visualization for an 8 second inhale, 10 second exhale. Breaths are counted at the completion of each exhale.

This project is a sample from an admin interface for a client. For this sample, I adjusted layout to work in Bootstrap (for simplicity sake), and used [Initializr](www.initializr.com) as a boilerplate.
